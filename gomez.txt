Dear %%first_name%%,

Effective reading instruction for students who struggle requires research-based solutions that encourage learning. The most effective solutions are those that follow the structured literacy approach, as endorsed by the Texas Dyslexia Handbook. Structured literacy is not only vital for students with dyslexia, but research shows it is effective for all students.
